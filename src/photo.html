    <p>I loved collecting pretty stickers/posters when I was a kid, but never held a real camera until I turned 18.
    Since then, I started to save up for a DSLR camera, and learned photorgaphy, photo-retouching, photoshop-manipulation on my own. 
    I love taking portraits, landscapes, architectures, weddings, and food.
    I love photography because photos are return tickets to our past; because it gives me a chance to show the world how I view things and how the mundane can be turned into somehting exceptional.

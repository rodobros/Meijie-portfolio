                A Loan Origination System (LOS) owned by Accenture. Inside of MC, there’s Collaboration Center. It is a secured platform that connects lenders, 3rd party service providers and everyone related to a mortgage lending process.

                    Collabration center is a centralized platform that aims to facilitate the collaborations between everyone related in a mortgage process. The original product needed a full redesign because of poor adoption rate and customer satisfaction. During the research phase, I identified the core challenges that need to be resolved:

                    <br>However, based on user feedback and the positive reception during testing phases, it is evident that the improvements made to the Collaboration Center have had a significant impact on user satisfaction and overall usability.

                    I was not tasked to improve the registration process; however, during my research and heuristic analysis, I identified potential areas for improvement. The current process consisted of seventeen steps with numerous security checks, and the security checks became the ultimate stoppers to clients. In addition, basic plan clients had no direct way to contact support, leading them to reach out to professional plan clients and causing frustration among paying clients.          <br>
                    <br>
                    By closely working with customer service, developers and security teams, I worked diligently to reduce the number of steps from 17 to just 6, while still maintaining necessary security measure.

                    <br> 
                    <b>Problem 1</b>: Lenders don’t know what documents are needed to submit a proper order.
                    <br>
                    <b>Decision</b>: Have both required and optional files to reduce the back and forth.

                <p>
                    <b>Problem 2</b>: The main problem was related to the "<b>attach and upload</b>" flow.  The old design had a strong focus on attaching instead of uploading, so after users uploaded their document, they had to go back to the attach tab and search through the list of files to find the ones they had just uploaded. This unnecessarily slowed down the process and created frustration for sure. 
                    <br>
                    To understand the root cause of these issues, I engaged with different teams to learn about why the old product was designed that way, clients behaviours and the context of uploading a file, etc.  While deep diving into this problem, it revealed additional problems related to “File“ tab.

                <p>
                    With their pain points in mind, I decided to tackle the “File” area first because it will directly affect the “attach and upload” flow of ordering and messaging. I explored a few ideas, and finally decided to make “Files” a repository place.

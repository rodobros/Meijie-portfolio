                    Game analytics tools tend to have a deep learning curve since they are data-oriented. rob0 is a SaaS tool that don’t require math skill. Potential clients loved the idea of the project, but without a UX designer made the product very hard to use. Clients didn’t know how to use the product without constantly asking help from rob0. Everyone wasted a lot of time.  In order to acquire more clients, rob0 needed to overcome below challenges:

Users can have insights from real players to improve their conversion from day 1. Inside are: handy navigations, helpful directions, intuitive and dynamic layout for you to easily get started with the product.

                    Before this project, I had very little knowledge about gaming industry in general. Even after knowing about the painpoints of our customers, I had no idea how to solve the problems. So make sure I knew what I was getting into, and how I could improve their experience. I read bunch of articles to learn about game analytics and user behavior analytics tools. Through this quick research method, I learned about what features are common for these tools and potentially how rob0 could be improved.

I had meetings with my boss and colleagues at least once a week to brainstorm and make sure everyone’s synced. Thanks to the research I did, I was able to confidently suggesting features and changes. Finally taking into account of everyone’s needs and limitations, we decided to focus on redesigning the information architecture, adding MVP (Minimum viable product) and improve efficiency.

                    Projects - Each single project consists dev log, live users, project info. Dev log consists recordings of developing devices. Live users consists of recordings and statistics, graphs of real users. Project Info consists all info about a project such as member list, project plan etc.

                    <br>
                    For example, to start using rob0, they needed to read a long help guide (#1) on the website, the guide tells them to create a project and complete the description first, but didn’t tell them where to create the project, and there was no place to add description. Plus when looking at #2 project settings: this page actually contained both project and organization information. Even me I had no idea where this organization came from, and what certain CTA meant, such as “unlink”. It was almost impossible for our users to complete the setup process without getting help from robo.

                    Keeping the first-time user experience in mind, I started with onboarding flow. After learning about the setup process, I started to brainstorm how I would show to users. I experimented different ways of walking users through the onboarding flow: persona-based onboarding, interactive tour, video, check list, step-by-step guided tour...

                    “Device view” screen shows the recorded session for just one device during a single day. There are more than 30 sessions. Imagine just 10 devices with a playtest that last 3 days. boom, 900 sessions right there. With the old product, it was vey time consuming to find useful recordings. Plus the space on the right side is totally wasted when no video is selected.

                    After checking bunch of inspirations from other indirect and direct competitors, it seems to be very common to have a list view of all session recordings. To leverage our users familiarity with current design patterns. I also decided to include a list view. It was unclear what information should be added. Based on research and user interviews, for MVP, we finally decided to add key info such as date, time, # of notes, session preview, length of the session. Just this simple info will save users a lot of time when deciding which videos to watch.

                    To see the progress of the game, users needed to quickly toggle between sessions while watching recordings without switching pages. I spent some time trying to figure out how to show it without clutter the screen. Finally after exploring some options, I decided to break information into 3 sections  (Left: device/sessions; Middle:Video; Right: Info, activities, notes.) and have a dynamic layout with icons for users to hide and show sections as needed.

                <p>
                    The old product was very naive, it didn’t really have project information, nor organization information. For a B2B product, it is important for users to manage their projects & organizations.
                    The most challenging part of this was role permission design and constraints. For example, users are not allowed to delete themselves if there’s only one owner for a project, they can only transfer a paid project, etc. How do we convey these constraints / rules clearly to users without overwhelming them? To make sure these constraints were well designed, I had close communication with our back-end all the time.

                    While I was designing, I also created design system to help making sure the product will look as consistent as possible, The organized design system helped developers tremendously, and saved me a lot of time during explaining and handoff process.

                    I also helped them to create certain illustrations to improve the visual of the product.

                    I mostly focused on the b2b product. But in my spare time, I also helped to redesign the old website. It went from a single web page to an informative website that consists “landing page, pricing, company, jobs etc”. The mid-fidelity wireframes focused on showing the layout.

                        As a sole designer + First time working on an enterprise software + without much knowledge in AI game analytics itself, it was certainly scary at the beginning. After researching, talking to users and constantly bugging my colleagues to understand how the product works, I’m glad my design hit the bar.

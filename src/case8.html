                    Game analytics tools tend to have a deep learning curve since they are data-oriented. rob0 is a SaaS tool that doesn't require math skill. Potential clients loved the idea,but they didn’t know how to use the product without constantly asking help from rob0. In order to acquire more clients, rob0 needed to overcome below challenges:

Users can have insights from real players to improve their conversion from day 1. Inside are: handy navigations, helpful directions, intuitive and dynamic layout for you to easily get started with the product.

                    Before this project, I had very little knowledge about gaming industry in general. Even after knowing about the painpoints of our customers, I had no idea how to solve the problems. To make sure I knew what I was getting into, and how I could improve their experience. I read bunch of articles to learn about game analytics and user behavior analytics tools. Through this quick research method, I learned about what features are common for these tools and potentially how rob0 could be improved.

                    After research, we were tasked to launch rob0 with full billing ability in less than 4 months. With such a tight deadline, knowing how to prioritize became imperative. I had meetings with my boss and colleagues at least once a week to brainstorm and make sure everyone’s synced. Thanks to the research I did, I was able to confidently suggesting features and changes. 
                    <br>
                    Finally taking into account of everyone’s needs and limitations, we decided to focus on redesigning the information architecture, adding MVP (Minimum viable product) and improve efficiency. Below are the core functionalities: (red are the ones we didn’t add)

                   For example, to start using rob0, they needed to switch between different platforms including website, web app, and unity. They also needed to go back and forth between different pages. (#1,2,3). Basically information was everywhere and there was no clear instruction of what to do next. As a result, clients couldn't complete the setup process without getting help from robo.

                    Keeping the first-time user experience in mind, I started with onboarding flow. After learning about the setup process, I started to brainstorm how I would show to users. I experimented different ways of walking users through the onboarding flow: persona-based onboarding, interactive tour, video, check list, step-by-step guided tour...

                    I settled down with “<b>step-by-step guided tour</b>”, because:

                    <li>Users cannot use the product without completing certain steps.</li>

                    <li>Onboarding now is divided into few steps which greatly reduces users’ cognitive load.</li>
                    <li>It is quick since users don’t need to make any choice or input their billing info at this moment.</li>

                <p>
                    With the new product, users can easily get started with rob0 by themselves. The completion rate is 100% for setup process.

                    “Device view” screen shows the recorded session for just one device during a single day. There are more than 30 sessions. Imagine just 10 devices with a playtest that last for 3 days. boom, 900 sessions right there!  With the old product, there was almost no way to find useful recordings. Plus the space on the right side was totally wasted when no video was selected.

                    After checking out bunch of inspirations from other indirect and direct competitors, it seems to be very common to have a list view of all session recordings. To leverage our users familiarity with current design patterns. I also decided to include a list view. It was unclear what information should be added. Based on research, for MVP, we finally decided to add key info such as date, time, # of notes, session preview, length of the session.

                    To see the progress of the game, users needed to quickly toggle between sessions while watching recordings without switching pages.

Finally after exploring some options, I decided to break information into 3 sections  (Left: device/sessions; Middle:Video; Right: Info, activities, notes.) and have a dynamic layout with icons for users to hide and show sections as needed.

                    The old product was very naive, it only had one page with both project, organization name and members. For a B2B product, it is important for users to easily manage their projects & organizations.
                <br>
                <br>
                    The most challenging part of this was role permission design and constraints. For example, users are not allowed to delete themselves if there’s only one owner for a project, they can only transfer a paid project, etc. The questions were: Should I grey out the functions that users don’t have access to or simply don’t show them? How do I convey these constraints / rules clearly without overwhelming them? 
                    To make sure these constraints were well designed, I had close communication with our back-end all the time.

                    Below are some of the design details.

                    While I was designing, I also created this design system to help making sure the product will look as consistent as possible, The organized design system helped developers tremendously, and saved me a lot of time during explaining and handoff process.

                    I mostly focused on the b2b product. But in my spare time, I also helped to redesign the old website. It went from a single web page to an informative website that consists “landing page, pricing, company, jobs etc”. The mid-fidelity wireframes focused on showing the layout.

                        As a sole designer + First time working on an enterprise software + without much knowledge in AI game analytics itself, it was certainly scary at the beginning. After researching, talking to users and constantly bugging my colleagues to understand how the product works, I’m glad my design hit the bar.

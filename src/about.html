  	<h2>Bonjour encore, 👋 </h2>
  	<p>A little about me:</p>
  	<ul>
  		<li>You can call me 美洁 (Mei Jie) or Maggie.</li>
  		<li>I’m Chinese-Canadian, currently living in Waterloo, ON.</li>
  		<li>I’ve lived in 4 countries 🇨🇳 🇨🇦 🇫🇷 🇺🇸</li>
  		<li>I speak 3 languages (Mandarin, English, French)</li>
  		<li>I'm a self-taught photogtapher</li>
  	</ul>
    <p>I’m a UX/UI designer who believes in creating visually appealing and intuitive products.</p>
    <p>Experiencing life in different places has shaped me into a problem solver, an empathetic and adaptive designer. I love to learn from different people and the insights I gain from them serve as the main drive behind my design.</p>
    <p>After being in different fields including Photography, Marketing, and Supply Chain Management, I finally decided to pursue my childhood dream as a designer. I then took UX/UI courses on Udemy, participated in the 100 Daily UI challenge, and graduated from UX Academy. My diverse experiences have made me become user-oriented and helped to sharpen my skills in research, analysis and aesthetics.</p>
    <p>When I design, I try my best to balance well business and user goals. When I’m not designing, I enjoy ✈️travelling, taking photos with my 📷Nikon D750, collecting 🌇pretty pictures, going to 💪 gym and eating 🌶spicy food.</p>
    <p>A lover of lifelong learning and trying new things, I am always on the lookout for opportunities. If you are interested, let me know.</p>

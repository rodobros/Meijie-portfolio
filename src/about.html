  	<h2>Bonjour encore, 👋 </h2>
  	<p>A little about me:</p>
  	<ul>
  		<li>I’m Chinese-Canadian, currently living in Waterloo, ON.</li>
  		<li>I’ve lived in 4 countries 🇨🇳 🇨🇦 🇫🇷 🇺🇸</li>
  		<li>I Speak 3 languages (Mandarin, English, French)</li>
  	</ul>
    <p>I’m a UX/UI designer who believes in creating minimal, visually appealing, and intuitive products. I push myself to understand what is really important and designing simple solutions.</p>
    <p>Experiencing life in different places has shaped me into a problem solver, an empathetic and adaptive designer. I love to learn from different people and the insights I gain from them serve as the main drive behind my design.</p>
    <p>Graduated with distinction and double majored in Marketing and Supply Chain Management. This helped me to be user-oriented, and further enhanced my research and analytical skills. In my most recent role, I was a purchasing coordinator/analyst in a furniture company surrounded with designers. By consistently interacting with them at work, I finally decided to pursue my childhood dream as a designer.</p>
    <p>When I design, I try my best to balance well business and user goals. When I’m not designing, I enjoy ✈️travelling, collecting 🌇pretty pictures, going to 💪 gym and eating 🌶spicy food. I’m also a self-taught photographer who enjoys 📷taking photos with my Nikon D750.</p>
    <p>A lover of lifelong learning and trying new things, I am always on the lookout for opportunities. If you are interested, let me know.</p>
